==========

A new Mars Rover is to be landed by NASA on Mars. 
To simplify navigation, the planet has been divided up into a grid. The rover's position and location is represented by a combination of x and y co-ordinates and a letter representing one of the four cardinal compass points. In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. The only commands you can give the rover are ‘F’,’B’,’L’ and ‘R’

Notes
----------

*	The API can be found in the APP.models namespace
*	The [JSCheck] (http://www.jscheck.org/) property based testing approach is used. Tests are generated according to invariants, 1000 tests are run in total.
*	[Underscore.js] (http://underscorejs.org/) is used for operations on sequences.
*	[This similar sample] (http://bertranddechoux.github.io/d3js-sandbox/mower-demo/index.html) makes use of [d3.js] (d3js.org) for visualizations and has been modified here for similar purposes.
